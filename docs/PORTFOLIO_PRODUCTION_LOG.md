# Portfolio Production Log — "Human Systems" (v2)

Compact, reusable record of what shipped, when, and against which decision. Append one entry per work session or milestone — do not narrate day-to-day process. See [PORTFOLIO_DIRECTION_V2.md](PORTFOLIO_DIRECTION_V2.md) for the design contract and [PORTFOLIO_AUDIT_V2.md](PORTFOLIO_AUDIT_V2.md) for the originating audit.

## Log

### 2026-07-14 — Direction document defined

**Stage:** Foundation
**Scope:** docs only (`PORTFOLIO_DIRECTION_V2.md`, `PORTFOLIO_PRODUCTION_LOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
**Did:**
- Wrote the full design contract: concept, principles, palette, typography roles, grid/spacing, homepage/project-page structure, image treatment, per-project accents, motion, responsive rules, accessibility requirements, anti-patterns, evidence/ownership/embed preservation rules, and the Hero System section.
- Recorded approved architecture decisions in CLAUDE.md.

**Decisions:**
- None beyond what's recorded in the direction doc and CLAUDE.md — no HTML/CSS/JS was touched this session.

**Verified:**
- N/A — documentation only, no runtime surface to check.

**Open:**
- Final hero composition not yet selected — to be resolved via isolated visual prototypes (`/v2-preview/`) per Approved amendment #1.
- Per-project accent hex values beyond BETTR's existing `#EB5160` family not yet finalized (FrankenTeen, CardioPal, Echoes, Smartphone Mold/Playing Freedom).
- CardioPal and Playing Freedom imagery not yet sourced.

**Commit:** _pending_
